        description: "Slay narcissists—the ultimate bullies—in negotiation by following this simple formula, developed by a top attorney, which takes you from feeling like a victim to being victorious! Whether your relationship is business or personal, narcissists have a way of making you feel like you are so special. The relationship begins with you believing they are the most charming, charismatic person you’ve ever met, and ends up being one in which hell actually would be a relief. Their skill for reading people is unparalleled. Their knack for honing in on their prey is cunning. The population of narcissists is becoming an epidemic, and thus, we can no longer continue to ignore it. The problem is that we’ve been applying a blanket approach to negotiation and communication with narcissists and expecting them to work like they do with reasonable people. But narcissists’ brains are not wired the same as reasonable people and therefore they do not think in the same way. That is why a conventional approach to negotiation always fails.",

This about you feeling valued, honored, and respected and setting yourself up so nothing and no one can ever infringe on that. After twenty years of dealing with narcissists as an attorney and unfortunately, dealing with them in her personal life, Rebecca has a deep understanding of a narcissist’s psyche. She has that understanding turned into a simple step by step process to get what you want.",
